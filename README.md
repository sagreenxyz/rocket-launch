# Rocket Launch
## Taking it further...
Currently, the rocketName change causes the countdown to completely reset. Try to come up with a way to prevent this behavior from happening! hint: you will need to move existing elements into a new component!
Consider how one could dynamically render the value of counter to the screen. What changes would we need to make in order to cause that render?
